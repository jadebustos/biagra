# B.I.A.G.R.A

B.I.A.G.R.A stands for **BI**bliotec**A** de pro**GR**amación científic**A** which means Scientific Programming Library.

This library was created when I was studying my degree to ease my academic tasks when I was not forced to use Mathematica, Matlab, SPSS, Linpro, ANSYS, Statgraphics, ...

About the name? Well, for those days a new medicine was introduced into the market, my mind ...

First version was published in 1.998 but it is was not widely distributed.

Some months ago I started reviewing my backups to centralize useful stuff into only one repository and I found this library. Unfortunately the version I found was one of the first versions so a lot of stuff is missing:

* Matrix operations.
* Matrix factorization.
* System linear equations.
* Partial differential equations.

This library was originally written in Spanish so I decided to translate into English and making it public available on Github.

It is important to remark that this release candidate version has not been tested and the results maybe not be accurate enough. I will check and add tests to check it in a not distant future.

Today there are a lot of resources in many programming languages but in the days this library was published there was no much stuff available due to access to the internet was not as generalized as nowadays.

If you want to know how to use C language for scientific programming this code could be useful, specially how pointers are used to optimize memory usage and how function's pointers are used to abstact C functions from the mathematical functions they are going to use.
