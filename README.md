# B.I.A.G.R.A

B.I.A.G.R.A stands for **BI**bliotec**A** de pro**GR**amación científic**A** which means Scientific Programming Library.

This library was created when I was studying my degree to ease my academic tasks when I was not forced to use Mathematica, Matlab, SPSS, Linpro, ANSYS, Statgraphics, ...

About the name? Well for those days a new medicine was introduced into the market, my mind \dots

First version was published in 1.998 but it is was not widely distributed.

Some months ago I started reviewing my backups to centralize useful stuff into only one repository and I found this library. Unfortunately the version I found was one of the first versions so a lot of stuff is missing:

* Matrix operations.
* Matrix factorization.
* System linear equations.
* Partial differential equations.

This library was originally written in Spanish so I decided to translate into English and making it public available on Github.

It is important to remark that this release candidate version has not been tested and the results maybe not accurate enough. I will check and add tests to check it in a not distant future.

Today there are a lot of resources in many programming languages but in the days this library was published there was no much stuff available due to access to the internet was not as generalized as nowadays.

If you want to know how to use C language for scientific programming this code could be useful, specially how pointers are used to optimize memory usage and how function's pointers are used to abstact C functions from the mathematical functions they are going to use.

I will also add some code I created to test how a Fujitsu Primergy server scaled using Pi digits calculations.

I do not have any plans to increase this library. If I find the missing code I will add it though.

It is possible that I add some code from time to time due to the possibility I have to code some numerical methods in the future.

I hope this code is useful for you.




This library was developed by me to perform my duties at University when I needed to program them instead of using Mathematica/Matlab/Octave ... 

Unfortunately I couldn't find a more recent version of the library so some functions are lost. Maybe I can find a more recient version in some old backup and then I will update this repo.

Some of the lost functions were related to:

* System of linear equations
* Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
* Matrix factorization
* Partial differential equations

All the code and documentation (biagra.pdf) was originally written in spanish. Now I am translating into English and adapting code.

The documentation was not finished.

At this very moment I am doing the following:

* translating into English (code and documentation)
* creating documentation, most of it was missing
* cleaning the code
* including examples of how BIAGRA can be used
* At this moment code has not been properly tested

When I originally created this code the Spanish motto was "Algún día esta biblioteca será la ...." :)
